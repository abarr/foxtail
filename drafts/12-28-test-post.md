 Conferences are an excellent way to hear new ideas, see exciting projects and learn how to solve problems in creative ways. However, it seems that as technologists we keep trying to explain how teams should work together over and over again.

We hear about SCRUM, LEAN, KANBAN along with many other frameworks and methodologies. We hear how Teams use retrospectives and peer reviews. We talk about communication tools and planning platforms. Last week I heard about full project teams getting together to make decisions collectively to encourage ownership.

For some time I have been trying to reconcile all of this and think about what we are trying to achieve. If we dispense with all of the fancy frameworks, I would argue that we are first and foremost trying to create cohesive and successful teams. Whether you use sticky notes on a whiteboard, an elegant software tool or even email, if you build a good team, the peripheral decisions about tooling and methodologies are probably irrelevant. I think team sports worked this out a long time ago.

I played Rugby for 20 years (Although everything I will describe works for any team sport). For those unfamiliar with the game, there are 15 players on the field and eight reserves for each team. Everyone has a specialist position, and a few will be able to play in one or two other positions if needed. Broadly the team is split into Forwards (Bigger, Slower) and Backs (Smaller, faster). The most famous Rugby Team in the world is the All Blacks from NZ.

When you have the ball, the team will reorganise itself into an attacking formation in real time. Backs and Forwards working together to move the ball around the field probing for weaknesses in the opposition. When you don’t have the ball, the team needs to change to a defensive formation dynamically. Fixing weaknesses and moving to counter the opposition as they probe for an opening.

As a player and coach, I have come to understand there are five basic rules followed by successful teams:

Work hard at being great at your position. If you are a kicker; practice kicking, if you are a winger; practice sprinting
Trust the person next to you to do their job. E.g. Trust the person inside you to make their tackle. If you don’t, you leave a hole where you should have been, but if they miss, lend a hand
Talk to each other. There is no other way for 15 people to organise themselves without speaking with each other about what is happening
No Dickheads. Dickheads destroy teams
Adjust your plans to meet every challenge and weakness, not only during a game but also while preparing for the next one
I think each of these is directly translatable to a work team. But rather than stating the rules explicitly we tend to wrap them into processes and frameworks (Completely natural of course because that is what we tend to do as technologists).

I have seen this happen and I agree with one of the inventors of agile development that the industry that has sprung up around transforming development teams has made it worse (Agile is Dead: https://youtu.be/a-BOSpxYJ9M).

The various frameworks being touted by consultants provide an opportunity for bad teams to hide behind the process and methodology buzz words. Before thinking about methodologies and tools I think we can benefit far more from focussing on building teams that:

Have passionate people who want to be great at their job and keep learning, practising and evolving
Trust their colleagues to deliver but if they don’t jump in and give them help
Talk to each other about what is happening, good and bad, rather than troll each other on a chat platform
Filter out the Dickheads; no matter how smart they are they will destroy the team
Embrace the concepts of agility (not the hype) and keep adjusting to meet challenges head-on
 

If you are looking at redesigning a team or have introduced a new methodology but the team is struggling under process overload drop me a line I would love to chat about how I might be able to help (www.foxtail.consulting).
